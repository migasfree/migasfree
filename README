Behaviour
=========

How can you change the software configuration of machines with migasfree?

When an user opens a graphic session in the machine, migasfree client queries the migasfree Server and it responds with a code survey to execute in the client, created *ad hoc* for this client after consulting the database.

This code survey is executed in the client and basically configures the repositories of packages (rpm or deb). Previously, these repositories have been created for the server when the migasfree's administrator configures a repository.

A repository in migasfree server defines the packages that should be installed, updated or removed in the clients in function of attributes of client computer: **HOSTNAME**, **USER**, **CONTEXT LDAP**, **VIDEO CARD**, ... (the administrator defines the properties that he wants to use in his organization).

All changes of configuration in the clients are made through packages. Therefore it is necessary that you know how create packages in order to change the configuration of the machines that you want administrate. You can consider hiring a professional, this is the hard work, you were warned!


Use
===

For example: You want change the Firefox homepage in all PCs in a range of IPs.

    1. You must create a package (for example ``myorg-firefox-1-0.rpm`` or ``myorg-firefox-1-0.deb``). You must investigate which files need to be modified and allow the package to perform the task of changing the configuration. This is hard work!

    2. You must upload your package to the server. This is simple!

    3. You must create a repository in migasfree server. Add your package ``myorg-firefox-1-0`` and define the range of IPs. This is easy!

    4. *Voilà!* When a user opens a graphic session and his IP is in range, migasfree client install the package.
